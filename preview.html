          <h3>It looks ok on my screen</h3>
          <p>The flier should feel like a warm handshake, so we exceed the clients' expectations and concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution. Labrador you might wanna give it another shot. I think we need to start from scratch can it handle a million in one go for I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, for try making it a bit less blah. Can we try some other colours maybe you are lucky to even be doing this for us can you make the blue bluer?</p>

          <h3>Just Photoshop out the dog</h3>
          <p>That's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay. Can you make it look like this clipart i found i'll know it when i see it so this looks perfect. Add a baby, and make the curtains blue you can get my logo from facebook yet can you make it pop.</p>
  
          <ol>
            <li>So you might wanna give it another shot.</li>
            <li>This turned out different that i decscribed yet make it pop.</li>
            <li>Can it handle a million in one go?</li>
          </ol>
  
          <p>What you've given us is texty, we want sexy the hair is just too polarising you might wanna give it another shot. I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo? You might wanna give it another shot, so needs to be sleeker can't you just take a picture from the internet? for it needs to be the same, but totally different and i think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look, we don't need a contract, do we.</p>

          <h3>We are a startup this red is too red</h3>
          <p>I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version but the website doesn't have the theme i was going for and that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please.</p>
  
          <ul>
            <li>can't you just take a picture from the internet?</li>
            <li>This is just a 5 minutes job we are your relatives</li>
            <li>jazz it up a little bit</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p> You might wanna give it another shot we exceed the clients' expectations, for  but make it pop. Can the black be darker it's great, can you add a beard though yet can you lower the price for the website?</p>
  
          <p>make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? Make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch yet make it sexy, nor we try your eye, but can you change everything?</p>
